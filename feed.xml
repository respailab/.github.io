Existing frameworks based on Shapley values are often too computationally expensive due to the need for repeated model training. In our paper, we introduce <strong>EcoVal</strong>, a novel and efficient framework for data valuation. By working with clusters of similar data points rather than individual samples, EcoVal estimates data value quickly and practically.</p> <p>Our method innovatively formulates model performance as a production function‚Äîa concept from economic theory‚Äîto determine the intrinsic and extrinsic value of data. We provide a formal proof of our technique and demonstrate its effectiveness with both in-distribution and out-of-sample data, addressing the challenge of efficient data valuation at scale.</p> <hr/> <h3 id="key-contributions">Key Contributions</h3> <ul> <li><strong>EcoVal Framework:</strong> Efficiently estimates data value by clustering similar data points.</li> <li><strong>Economic Theory Application:</strong> Uses the production function concept to determine data value.</li> <li><strong>Formal Proof:</strong> Provides a robust theoretical foundation for the technique.</li> <li><strong>Real-World Application:</strong> Demonstrates effectiveness with both in-distribution and out-of-sample data.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3> <p>A great collaborative effort by the amazing team:</p> <ul> <li>Vikram Singh Chundawat</li> <li>AYUSH KUMAR</li> <li>TARUN</li> <li>Hong Ming Tan</li> <li>Bowei Chen</li> <li>Mohan Kankanhalli</li> </ul> <p>We look forward to discussing our findings and connecting with fellow researchers in Barcelona!</p> <hr/> <iframe src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:7199085926063489025" height="934" width="504" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" title="Embedded post"></iframe> <hr/> <h3 id="join-the-conversation">Join the Conversation</h3> <p>Follow our journey and join the conversation using the hashtags: #KDD2024 #DataScience #MachineLearning #AI #DataValuation #ResearchInnovation #ACMSIGKDD</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="ResearchInnovation"/><category term="KDD2024"/><category term="DataScience"/><category term="MachineLearning"/><category term="AI"/><category term="DataValuation"/><category term="ResearchInnovation"/><category term="ACMSIGKDD"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Excited to share that our paper, 'EcoVal: Efficient Data Valuation Framework for Machine Learning Models,' has been accepted to KDD 2024!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Collaborative AI Solutions for Predicting Infection Severity</title><link href="https://respailab.github.io/blog/2024/ILD-prediction/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Collaborative AI Solutions for Predicting Infection Severity"/><published>2024-04-15T12:57:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-15T12:57:00+00:00</updated><id>https://respailab.github.io/blog/2024/ILD-prediction</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://respailab.github.io/blog/2024/ILD-prediction/"><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to announce our latest collaboration with Dr. Sakir from KIIMS. Dr. Sakir has meticulously collected an extensive dataset and identified several critical problems that can be addressed using artificial intelligence. This partnership is paving the way for innovative real-world solutions in healthcare.</p> <p>Our primary focus is on developing an AI-driven model to predict the severity of infections within a specific timeframe. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and the rich dataset provided by Dr. Sakir, we aim to create a tool that can assist healthcare professionals in making more informed decisions and improving patient outcomes.</p> <h3 id="objectives-of-the-collaboration">Objectives of the Collaboration:</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Data Collection and Problem Formulation:</strong> Thanks to Dr. Sakir‚Äôs expertise, we have access to a comprehensive dataset that includes various patient parameters and infection details.</li> <li><strong>AI Implementation:</strong> Our team is dedicated to implementing state-of-the-art AI algorithms to analyze the dataset and predict infection severity accurately.</li> <li><strong>Real-World Application:</strong> The ultimate goal is to deploy this predictive model in clinical settings, providing a valuable resource for healthcare providers to manage and treat infections more effectively.</li> </ul> <h3 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters:</h3> <p>Predicting the severity of an infection can significantly impact treatment strategies and patient care. With accurate predictions, doctors can prioritize resources, customize treatment plans, and potentially save lives by intervening early in severe cases.</p> <p>We are committed to advancing healthcare through innovative AI solutions and are confident that this collaboration with Dr. Sakir will yield significant benefits for the medical community.</p> <p>Stay tuned for more updates as we progress in this groundbreaking project!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Healthcare"/><category term="AI"/><category term="Healthcare"/><category term="Collaboration"/><category term="Predictive-Analytics"/><category term="Infection-Severity"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Explore our collaboration with Dr. Sakir from KIIMS, where we're using AI to predict infection severity and improve patient outcomes.]]></summary></entry></feed>
